Answers
=======

1. **Answer:** c. All of them

   **Explanation:** KPIs for DevOps include mean time to failure recovery, deployment frequency, percentage of failed deployments, and even metrics like failed HTTP connections. These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive view of system performance and reliability.

2. **Answer:** b. Release

   **Explanation:** Agile ceremonies include Retrospective, Review, and Refinement. Release, while important, is a process rather than a ceremony.

3. **Answer:** a. build, test, release

   **Explanation:** Continuous integration involves building the code, testing it, and preparing it for release.

4. **Answer:** b. Tensorflow

   **Explanation:** Tensorflow is a machine learning library, not a DevOps tool like Jenkins, Kubernetes, or Ansible.

5. **Answer:** a. All of them

   **Explanation:** DevOps principles include automating tasks, measuring performance, failing fast, and continuously improving.

6. **Answer:** c. All of them

   **Explanation:** Continuous integration, delivery, deployment, and monitoring are core DevOps practices.

7. **Answer:** c. Accountability

   **Explanation:** While accountability is crucial in any organization, DevOps culture emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and trust.

8. **Answer:** e. All of them

   **Explanation:** All the listed items are principles of the Agile Manifesto.

9. **Answer:** c. All of them

   **Explanation:** Sprint, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Sprint Planning are all Scrum artefacts.

10. **Answer:** a. Planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance

    **Explanation:** This is the complete Software Development Life Cycle.

11. **Answer:** a. Site Reliability Engineering

    **Explanation:** SRE applies software engineering principles to infrastructure and operations problems.

12. **Answer:** a. A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.

    **Explanation:** Sprints are typically 1-4 weeks long and focused on delivering specific objectives.

13. **Answer:** a. The Product Owner with the most valuable items placed at the top.

    **Explanation:** The Product Owner prioritizes the backlog based on business value.

14. **Answer:** b. The Development Team includes cross-skilled individuals who are able to contribute to do what is necessary to deliver an increment of software.

    **Explanation:** Cross-functional teams possess the skills needed to complete their tasks independently.

15. **Answer:** b. The Development Team.

    **Explanation:** The team decides how to perform the work during the Sprint.

16. **Answer:** b. False

    **Explanation:** A single Product Backlog should be maintained for the entire product.

17. **Answer:** b. Additional features in a usable state that complement those delivered in previous iterations.

    **Explanation:** Incremental development adds new, usable functionality in each iteration.

Write your first Hello World!
=============================

Here are examples of printing "Hello World!" in various programming languages. Follow the links to online interpreters to try them yourself:

- **Python**:

  .. code-block:: python

      print('Hello, world!')
      print('My name is XXX')

- **Bash**:

  .. code-block:: bash

      echo "Hello World"
      echo "My name is XXX"

- **Go**:

  .. code-block:: go

      package main
      import "fmt"
      func main() {
          fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
          fmt.Println("My name is XXX")
      }
